## Current Goals
- Add data fetching for products and stores
- Set up Firebase for cart persistence
- Implement checkout flow with PayPal
- Add error boundaries and loading states
- Add product search functionality
- Set up pagination for store and product grids

## Open Questions
1. Should we add a search functionality to the store and product lists?
2. Do we need pagination for the store and product grids?
3. Should we implement a wishlist feature alongside the cart?
4. How should we handle out-of-stock products?

## Implementation Notes
- All pages using Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme configuration
- Cart state management implemented with Context API
- Cart functionality includes add, remove, update quantity
- PayPal integration is ready but needs sandbox credentials
- Need to implement error boundaries and loading states
- Should consider adding image optimization
- Cart persistence will require Firebase setup
