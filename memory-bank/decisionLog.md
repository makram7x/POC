# Decision Log

## [2025-03-16] - Initial Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack Selection
**Context:** Need to choose appropriate technologies for a POC shopping mall web application.
**Decision:** Using React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Firebase.
**Rationale:** 
- Vite provides fast development experience and modern build tooling
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with mobile-first approach
- React Router is the standard for React applications
- Firebase offers simple cart persistence without complex backend setup
**Implementation:** Will be implemented in phases according to the development plan.

### Data Management Strategy
**Context:** Need to determine how to handle store and product data.
**Decision:** Using hard-coded data for stores and products, Firebase only for cart persistence.
**Rationale:**
- Simplifies POC development
- Reduces backend complexity
- Allows focus on frontend user experience
**Implementation:** Store data will be maintained in static JavaScript objects.

### Authentication Approach
**Context:** Need to handle user sessions for cart management.
**Decision:** Using anonymous sessions without user authentication.
**Rationale:**
- Simplifies user experience
- Reduces implementation complexity
- Still allows for cart persistence
**Implementation:** Firebase anonymous sessions will be used to track cart data.

### Mobile-First Development
**Context:** Need to ensure good mobile user experience.
**Decision:** Adopting mobile-first design approach with Tailwind CSS.
**Rationale:**
- Ensures optimal mobile experience
- Tailwind's responsive utilities make implementation straightforward
- Mobile is likely primary use case for shopping application
**Implementation:** Will use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints and mobile-first design patterns.

### Payment Processing
**Context:** Need secure and reliable payment processing.
**Decision:** Using PayPal JavaScript SDK with Sandbox environment.
**Rationale:**
- PayPal provides robust payment processing
- Sandbox environment allows safe testing
- Well-documented integration process
**Implementation:** Will be implemented in the checkout phase using PayPal's recommended practices.
